#### PLANNING, PROCESS & PROBLEM SOLVING:
I planned out the project first by coming up with an idea I was excited about. From there, wireframes and user stories took place which made it much easier to implement the next step, backend. Once back-end was set up, I moved to implementing front-end functionality. The final step was styling.

Along the way, there were both front-end and back-end bugs and I utilized the terminal/browser console.logs() a lot in the process of debugging. This helped me easily trace back to the source of the problem. To reduce the amount of bug encounters, I always planned out in my head how I wanted to implement the structure of classes and functions before I began coding.
